# E-commerce

## Description

This application demonstrates a basic back-end for an e-commerce site using a simple object model involving categories, tags, and products. Routes have been built to retrieve all data from each table as well as paths for Creating, Updating, and Deleting records. In the case of updating products, an array of tag ids can be provided in the request body to reassociate those records.
